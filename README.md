## [The Cogent Community Charter](<Cogent Community Charter.md>)
We are the Community.  All the contribute are welcome, all that they provide is treasured.  The Cogent Community Project (CoCoPro) is a collection of Cogent Roleplay players that banded together for the purpose of continuing the development and promotion of the Cogent Roleplay game.  We are eternally grateful to Shad and Jazza Brooks for the creation of this game we love, and we hope to continue its legacy.  The Cogent Community Project has adopted the Cogent Community Charter to establish the expectations of Community Members.  The general rules are:

1. **We are the Community!** Treat all Community Members equally and respectfully.
2. **See a Need, Fill a Need!** Bring your unique tools and ideas to the table.
3. **Nothing is Sacred, Everything is Permissible!** Understand where we came, but do not let it hold us back from greatness.
4. **Monetization of the Community.** Copyright stays with the creators.  Feed the artists.

## [Welcome and Introduction](<Welcome and Introduction.md>)

**Cogent Roleplay** is the creation of Josiah (Jazza) and Shad Brooks.  they created the game with an intent to overcome the many challenges they faces with Tabletop, Pen and Paper, Role-playing games they were playing at the time.  In 2023, **Cogent Roleplay** released their first full version, and Jazza handed over development of the game to the Cogent Community.  This has been a labour of love for us.  We hope you cherish your experiences play this game to the same level we had in developing it.

Have fun!  Play games!
