# Feedback & Support

## Acknowledgements

### Thank you to the Founders

Every Story has a beginning, and every project has its founders.  **Cogent Roleplay** is the creation of [Josiah (Jazza) Brooks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHu2KNu6TtJ0p4hpSW7Yv7Q) and [Shad Brooks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmMACUKpQeIxN9D9ARli1Q).  They were seeking to create a tabletop roleplaying game that addressed many of the issues they saw in the TTRPG industry at the time.  We of the **Cogent Community Project** wouldn't have been able to work on this project if it wasn't for them, and to that we owe them our thanks.

## Support the Projects

### Help Keep the Lights On

Currently the **Cogent Community Project** does not have a method to donate financially to the project.  Please reach out to the **Cogent Community Project** if you wish to help us publish and distribute our game to the market.  All revenue and profit from **Cogent Roleplay** must align with the **Cogent Community Charter**, and the licensing detailed within.

### Spread Cogent

The best way you can help the **Cogent Community Project** is by sharing **Cogent Roleplay** with as many people as possible.  Hold gaming nights, make videos about Cogent, and share the rules with as many people as possible.  Be welcoming to other members of the **Cogent Community** (especially new players), and if you want to go beyond being an active promoter, volunteer.

## Get Involved

The **Cogent Community Project** is built on volunteers.  We ask of all **Cogent Community** members to give your time and expertise in the manner you feel has value to you.  We want the **Cogent Community Project** to be a Community first and foremost, and we want you to know you helped make it a success.  The **Cogent Community Project** is always looking for volunteers.  If you are interested here are some common ways you can contribute.

### Volunteer Opportunities

**Playtesters:** We always need Narrators and Players to test out all the new features and modifications we did to the rules.  If you play **Cogent Roleplay** on a regular bases, please reach out to the **Cogent Community Project** to get access to the list of new features that need testing.  Give us your transparent and honest feedback (no matter how harsh or sweet).  Be sure to include both the Narrator and Players' names/handles for recognition.

**Translators:**  To date, **Cogent Roleplay** has been an English project.  The **Cogent Community** is made up of Narrators and Players from all four corners of the globe.  Help us make **Cogent Roleplay** a global community.  If you are a native speaker in a non-english language, please take the **Cogent Roleplay** rules, run them through a translation tool (like Google Translate), and then edit them in your native language so it is culturally and grammatically correct.  If a group of translators assist with the translation, be sure to include everyone's name/handle for recognition.

**Artists:** Any artwork created for the **Cogent Community Project** will remain the copyright property of the artist that created the work.  By contributing to the **Cogent Community Project** the artist is giving non-commercial permission to use their artwork (with appropriate recognition) to all **Cogent Community** members.  Artists are encouraged to include profit sharing clauses to their submissions so that any commercial product from the **Cogent Community** will be fair and equitable.

**World Builders:** Every TTRPG needs settings and campaigns to play.  The **Cogent Community Project** wants to draw from the **Cogent Community** to build a library of stories that new Narrators and Players can draw from.  We are looking for full settings, campaigns/one shots, and tools for **World Builders**.  All contributions must respect existing copyright material, and formally recognize the source of all material combined in the contribution.  **World Builders** retain the copyright property of unique content they create, but give non-commercial permission to use their material to all **Cogent Community** members.  Be sure to include all World Builders' names/handles for recognition.  

**Editors:** Similar to our **Translators**, we are seeking volunteers that have a good grasp of the english language and can edit both the **Cogent Community Project** content, but also (upon request), content from the **Cogent Community**.  All english language writing should follow the English (US) standard for spelling and grammar.  Be sure to include your name/handle for recognition.

**Developers:** The **Cogent Community Project** is a community effort, and we are always looking for people to submit ideas for new rules, modification of existing rules, and clarification of old rules.  All submissions must include the Chapter and section they are intended to replace, and be sure to include your name/handle for recognition.

**Homebrew:** The **Cogent Community Catalogue** is a collection of officially recognized **Cogent Roleplay** modules that Narrators are encouraged to add to their game to make **Cogent Roleplay** perfect for their Stories.  All submissions to the **Cogent Community Catalogue** must include what Chapter and section they are building on top of, and be sure to include all names/handles of contributors for recognition.
