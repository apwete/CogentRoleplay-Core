## 1. We are the Community

<p>The Cogent Community Project is a 100% volunteer organization. As such all that abide by the Charter and work on the project are considered part of the Cogent Community Project and part of the Community.  All Community Members</p>

1. **Respect each other's Work**
  
   All proposals, ideas, suggestions, and criticisms made within the Project are treated by the Community with equal respect and consideration.
2. **Welcome Everyone**
  
   Anyone who chooses to volunteer their time is welcome, and all their contributions are treated by the Community with equal respect and consideration.
3. **Not be a Troll**

   You are strong, because We are strong.  All Community Members are expected to act in a respectful way to all other Community Members.  Harassment, discrimination, or disrespect are not tolerated.

## 2. See a Need, Fill a Need

<p>The Cogent Community Project succeeds or fails as a Community.  When a fellow Community Member reaches out for help, their struggle is your struggle.  Do what you can to help them.</p>

1. **Ask for Help**

   Do not suffer alone.  If you run into a roadblock, reach out to the Community for help.
2. **Lend a Hand**

   Do not let your Community Members suffer alone.  If someone reaches out for help, do your best to find them the help they need (even if it is pointing them to a Community Member(s) that can help them).
3. **The Backlog**

   *Needs editing. Update based on answers to [Discord Comment](https://discord.com/channels/738912007620788234/1140670319955284088/1271077759107469312)*  The Project will be creating an Issue and Proposal Backlog of defects and features the Community Members wish to see in Cogent.  Community Members should:
   * **Help prioritize the list** All Community Members get to vote on all items. An item's priority is based on the number of votes it receives from Community Members.
   * **Help complete items on the list** As a Volunteer you do not need permission to take any item from the Backlog and work on it.  Let others know what you are working on, ***Ask for Help*** if needed, and ensure you save your work to the Project.

## 3. Nothing is Sacred, Everything is Permissible

<p>The Cogent Community is grateful to Shad and Jazza for giving us Cogent.  Without their foundation we would not have this Project.  But in order for the Project to grow, we must be free of any constraints. This is how we make Cogent the best tabletop roleplaying game ever.</p>

1. **No Idea is Stupid**

   All ideas, despite how you may think they sound, are treated with equal respect and consideration.  Community Members listen to ideas with an open mind, and give constructive criticism. The idea is then prioritized as an item in the Backlog.
2. **Give Constructive Criticism**

   When rejecting an idea or Backlog Item, any criticism must provide Volunteers a path to further fix and/or refine further.  If a Volunteer disagrees with an idea or Backlog Item, they state why. If a Volunteer has a way to improve the idea, they share it.
3. **No Item is Sacred, and *MUST* be tested**

   No item on the Backlog can be removed from the Backlog or added to a Release Candidate until after it has been through playtesting.  Playtests must not include the proposer of the item, and playtesters must treat the playtest with equal respect and consideration to any other item in the Backlog.
3. ***Proposed rewrite of point 3** Do not remove this or replace point 3 until [Discord post](https://discord.com/channels/738912007620788234/1140670319955284088/1271082134035107860) is responded to*

   Backlog Items are only removed after they have been playtested. Once playtested, the item is either moved forward to the Release Candidate list or discarded.  The Volunteer who proposed the idea cannot be a playtester. Playtesters playtesters provide feedback to (?Volunteer | Backlog Item | Discord?).
4. **Refine**

   After playtesting, a Backlog Item that does move forward as a Release Candidate can be refined by Volunteer(s) that still believe in it. They should use the playtest feedback to refine the idea and post it to the community again.

## 4. Monetization
